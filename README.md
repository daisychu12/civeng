This file contains code from a project I completed in my Engineering Data Analysis course at UC Berkeley, in which the relationship between climate change and the number of annual national park visitors was explored.
We acquired the data for “National Park Visitors” from the website data.world: https://data.world/inform8n/us-national-parks-visitation-1904-2016-with-boundaries, and “US climate change” from a github link on the spreadsheet https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-2C-beyond-the-limit-usa/.
